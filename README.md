# Mac-Multi-Tool-GUI

*A poor attempt at an Objective C rewrite of my Mac Multi-Tool script*

I suppose I've been slacking in the information-side of this project.  Sorry about that.  It's just kinda been a solo project, so it never really crossed my mind that other people might care haha.

It's time for the **breakdown**:

##What Is It?

This is *literally* just an attempt to re-wrap my *Mac Multi-Tool* script (also located on my github).

As of right now, it is only a simplistic front-end for the horrendously complex *DiskArbitration* framework.

It is written in a way that *should* make it easy to drop in new modules, so expandability is a priority.

There's some other functions peppered in, but we'll go over that in a second.

####Let's go over that.

* Real-time display of connected disks/partitions (even *unmounted* volumes!)
* Ability to mount/unmount those disks/partitions - fun for the kids ;)
* Repair permissions
* Rebuild Kext Cache
* Verify/Repair disks/partitions
* Create/Convert disk images

##What's next?

Well - *maybe* one of these days it'll have an icon - or some better code - or more features haha, but *who am I kidding??*

If the stars align just right, it'll be an all-in-one package for most of the things the Hackintosh community strives to do.

####Things I want to add.

* Erase disks/volumes
* Partition disks
* RAID (maybe...)
* ~~Create/Convert disk images~~ (added!)

After I have a solid foundation for *those* things, I'll start on the next modules.

##What modules?

I'm hoping to populate the toolbar at the top of the main window with other options (not *just* Disk Utility).

Oh, I'm sure, at this point - you *probably* want some examples of what else might be there?

Don't worry baby birds, I've got some knowledge-worms to feed you.

####Gross - that's not what we want...

Well, I'm already here.

New modules:

* USB Installer Creator
* Package extractor (both for launching .pgk files *and* for extracting only parts of them)
* Popup windows to give credit to the *real* devs out there
* Probably other things that I don't remember...

##Conclusions and the like

Hopefully my ramblings add some clarity to the topics at hand for you.

If you guys (or gals) have any questions, feel free to contact me.

####Where to contact?

- Okay - yeah, we get it.  Corp - enough with the headers...
